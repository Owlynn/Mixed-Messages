## Mixed Messages – Random Message Generator

This project is about creating a **message generator program**.  
Every time the program runs, the user should get a **new random message**.

In your case, you are building a **sentence generator with animals, verbs, and complements**, for example:  
> “the ostrich eats earthworms”

### Project goal

- **Build** a small JavaScript program.
- **Display** a different message every time the program is run.
- **Compose** each message from **at least three different pieces of data** (for example: subject, verb, complement / character, place, action, etc.).
- **Customize** the logic and content as you like.

### Chosen theme

- **Animals / verbs / complements**:  
  Example: “the cat spills a glass of water”, “the llama gazes at rainbows”, “the ostrich eats earthworms”, etc.

### Technical requirements

- Use the **JavaScript syntax** you have learned so far (variables, arrays, functions, etc.).
- Create **multiple data collections** (arrays, objects) for the different parts of the message.
- **Randomly select** one element from each collection.
- **Combine** these elements to form a full sentence.
- **Display** the message to the user (in the console or in another way).

### Expected result

By the end of the project, you will have a **standalone JavaScript program** that:

- Generates a **different, random message** every time it runs.
- Combines **at least three pieces of information** to build this message.
- Can easily be **modified and extended** (new texts, new data, new display formats).
