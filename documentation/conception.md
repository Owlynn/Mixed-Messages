## Design – Animal Message Generator

The program uses three arrays (`animals`, `verbs`, `items`) and randomly picks one value from each to build a funny sentence.
In Node.js, the script logs one random sentence in the console.
In the browser, an HTML page (`index.html`) shows a button **“Generate message”** and a text area; every click calls the generator function and updates the displayed sentence.
